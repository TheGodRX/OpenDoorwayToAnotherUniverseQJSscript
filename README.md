# OpenDoorwayToAnotherUniverseQJSscript
Opens a door to another universe.

This script assumes that a quantum algorithm has been developed 
to generate the desired quantum state, and that the quantum teleportation
circuit can send information to the new universe. These assumptions are purely 
hypothetical and do not reflect the current state of quantum computing research. 
Additionally, the safety and ethical concerns related to opening a doorway to another
universe remain significant and should not be ignored.
