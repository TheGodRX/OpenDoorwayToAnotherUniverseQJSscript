# OpenDoorwayToAnotherUniverseQJSscript

script: DO NOT USE THIS EVER!!! or Face the consequences..  Remember.. I warned you.

This code prompts the user to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe. When the user inputs "y", the turnTheKey() function is called. This function simulates the quantum circuit with only one shot to measure the qubits and check if the result is equal to "1" repeated dimensions number of times. If the result matches, the function confirms that the door has been opened and displays the parameters of the new universe. It then prompts the user to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "y", the program prints a message that the user has successfully swapped to the new universe and displays the parameters of the previous universe. If the user inputs "n", the program prints a message that the user chose not to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "n" when asked if they want to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe, the program prints a message that the doorway to the new universe remains closed.
