# OpenDoorwayToAnotherUniverseQJSscript
-script 1 Opens a door to another universe.

This script assumes that a quantum algorithm has been developed 
to generate the desired quantum state, and that the quantum teleportation
circuit can send information to the new universe. These assumptions are purely 
hypothetical and do not reflect the current state of quantum computing research. 
Additionally, the safety and ethical concerns related to opening a doorway to another
universe remain significant and should not be ignored.

-script 2 Turns A Key To Open A Doorway To Another Universe.

This code prompts the user to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe. When the user inputs "y", the turnTheKey() function is called. This function simulates the quantum circuit with only one shot to measure the qubits and check if the result is equal to "1" repeated dimensions number of times. If the result matches, the function confirms that the door has been opened and displays the parameters of the new universe. If the result does not match, the function confirms that the key failed to turn and suggests the user to try again. If the user inputs "n", the program prints a message that the door remains closed.

script 3 DO NOT USE THIS EVER!!! or Face the consequences..  Remember.. I warned you.
This code prompts the user to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe. When the user inputs "y", the turnTheKey() function is called. This function simulates the quantum circuit with only one shot to measure the qubits and check if the result is equal to "1" repeated dimensions number of times. If the result matches, the function confirms that the door has been opened and displays the parameters of the new universe. It then prompts the user to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "y", the program prints a message that the user has successfully swapped to the new universe and displays the parameters of the previous universe. If the user inputs "n", the program prints a message that the user chose not to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "n" when asked if they want to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe, the program prints a message that the doorway to the new universe remains closed.
