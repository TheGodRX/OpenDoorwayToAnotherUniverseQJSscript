# OpenDoorwayToAnotherUniverseQJSscript

script: DO NOT USE THIS EVER!!! or Face the consequences..  Remember.. I warned you.

This code prompts the user to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe. When the user inputs "y", the turnTheKey() function is called. This function simulates the quantum circuit with only one shot to measure the qubits and check if the result is equal to "1" repeated dimensions number of times. If the result matches, the function confirms that the door has been opened and displays the parameters of the new universe. It then prompts the user to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "y", the program prints a message that the user has successfully swapped to the new universe and displays the parameters of the previous universe. If the user inputs "n", the program prints a message that the user chose not to swap to the new universe. If the user inputs "n" when asked if they want to turn the key to open the door to the newly created universe, the program prints a message that the doorway to the new universe remains closed.

Q#.qs script :

To run this code, you need to have the Q# development kit installed on your computer. You can download and install it from the official Microsoft Quantum website: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/.

Once you have installed the Q# development kit, you can create a new Q# project and add the `Universe.qs` file to it. Then, you can build and run the project using the following commands in the terminal:

```
dotnet build
dotnet run
```

This will compile and execute the `Universe` operation in the `Universe.qs` file. You will be prompted to enter your name, date of birth, location coordinates, and other information to generate a new universe and open the doorway to it. You can choose a quantum gate to apply, and a target qubit to apply it to. If the key turns successfully, you will be able to swap to the new universe.
